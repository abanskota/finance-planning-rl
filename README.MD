# Financial goal planning with Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Welcome to the Financial Goal Planning with Reinforcement Learning (RL) repository!

Currently, this repository provides code for generating a custom OpenAI Gym environment for financial goal planning and running Monte Carlo simulations for a fixed policy.

I am currently working on developing the complete RL code for the problem, which will be available soon. If you are interested in learning more about financial planning with RL, check out my Medium article:
